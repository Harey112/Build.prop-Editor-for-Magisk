              Build.prop Editor
     Edit System property systemlessly!

Note: This module won't actually modify your
build.prop (found at/system/build.prop),
but instead, it will add your tweaks at module's
system.prop file which also being loaded
 by magisk after boot.

The creator will take no responsibility for any damage
cause by this module. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK


Shortcuts:       usage: editbp <shortcut>

    -C/-c - Create Profile
    -M/-m - Manage Profile
    -L|-l - View Properties
    -H/-h - Help Screen

    [e] - Enabled

I recommend to install TWRP Recovery and
Magisk Manager for recovery so you can immediately
disable this module if anything goes wrong.
